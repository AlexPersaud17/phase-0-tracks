# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to review changes that were made to a project, and restore to a previous version if you are unhappy with the current changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a duplicate copy of your main code and it is useful because it allows you to experiment with your code without altering the main version, and if you are eventually happy with the changes that were made, you can apply those changes to the main or master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a finalized change that has been made to a branch, and a good commit message is clear and concise and explains what changes were made to said branch.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when the two branches that you are looking to merge each have had changes that were made specifically to those branches.
