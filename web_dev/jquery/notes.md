jQuery!
Resources:
-Codecademy
-W3SChools
-Docs

Previously completed the jQuery lesson on Codecademy, so going through the other resources solidifed my understand of jQuery and how it works.
I also skimmed through the W3SChools tutorial which showed me how to properly link the files(the URL for the library itself, and the source for my file).
Since jQuery is pretty user-friendly, the jQuery docs listed all the fucntions that I can use, and the implementation of each is fairly similar to eachother.
