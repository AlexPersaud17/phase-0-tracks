# Reflection Section

# What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
#   The outer hash uses strings as key names while the inner hash uses symbols.

# What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
#   It locates the additional file needed using the relative location of the current file.

# What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
#   hash.each do |key, value|

# When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
#   Since they were instance variables, they were accessible throughout the class, and therefore didn't need to have any arguments pass through them.

# What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
#   After briefly touching on case statements previously, I became more comfortable using them.
